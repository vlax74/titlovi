1
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,480
You two gonna lend a hand, or what?

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Oh, must have nodded off.
We had two call-outs last night.

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,960
After a full day's lambing... again.
It's a poor do.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Lambs don't stop coming
just because you're weary.

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Come on. Let's be having you.

6
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,600
Sorry. It's good practice.
Sleepless nights.

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,880
Although, to get to the baby part,

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,440
we do have to spend time together
conscious.

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
I know. And we will.

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm actually cooking up a plan
to make sure of it. Ooh.

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,720
He comes highly recommended.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Top scholar in his year,
by all accounts.

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,200
It's only a placement, but
we'll finally have a new assistant.

14
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,840
Perfect.
Isn't it?

15
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
Hm. Have all your work, plus nights,

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,360
plus teaching this student
what's what. Aye.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah, but once I've trained them up,
I'll have someone to delegate to,

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
which means
more time for Helen and I.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,040
Till Siegfried sends him packing
after five minutes.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,400
Aye, like he always does.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,560
But he won't be
Siegfried's assistant.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,040
He'll be mine. Your own little James
to boss around.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,960
Exactly. And that's the difference.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Although I see myself
as more of a mentor. A what?

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
A guide.
Oh, aye?

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
No signs.

27
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Herriot?

28
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,440
Yes?
Mrs Hall's making Tristan's bed up.

29
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,720
Says we're expecting someone.
Because we are expecting someone.

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,560
T-The student we agreed to host.

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,520
Well, he's not having
Tristan's room.

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
He isn't?
You didn't say not to offer board.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,080
I didn't think I needed to.

34
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
I'll have a ring round.
See if I can find somewhere.

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Where is the boy, anyway?
Is he late? I don't believe so.

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,400
If he had anything about him,
he'd be early.

37
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,760
Mr Carmody's rather beholden
to the train from London.

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,400
That's his name, is it?
Richard Carmody, yes.

39
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,280
Richard Carmody. From London?
He won't last.

40
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,760
Right, I'm going to the Chapman's
to see Teasel.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, Uncle Herriot. Thank goodness.

42
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
It's the most dire emergency.

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,360
Cedric is my new foster.
His dad is away with the army.

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't wish to embarrass him,

45
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,040
but, um... it's something
of an anti-social malady.

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
He's not showing
signs of aggression, is he?

47
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,280
Oh, no, no, no, no.

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,800
On the contrary, he's
as gentle as they come, aren't you?

49
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,000
A tad excitable, though,

50
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,800
which does tend to exacerbate
things.

51
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,800
And what things
are we talking about, exactly?

52
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,640
H-He suffers from an excess...

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
Of?

54
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,520
Mind if I get that?
Hm.

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
Hello. I hope I'm in the right...
Richard Carmody?

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,320
Yes. I'm afraid I got somewhat lost.
James Herriot, come in.

57
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,440
Come in, come in.

58
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Round here.

59
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Right this way.

60
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,280
Mrs Pumphrey, I'd like you to meet
Richard Carmody,

61
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
our brilliant
new veterinary student.

62
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Delighted to make your acquaintance.
How do you do?

63
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,360
Well, this is all proving
rather cosy, isn't it?

64
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Mrs Pumphrey was just about to
tell me what's ailing Cedric here.

65
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes. Now, I know it's not his fault,
and it's perfectly natural,

66
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,360
but he does seem to suffer
really quite terribly from...

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,160
From...?
From...

68
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,280
Flatulence?

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Shh. All right, Teasel.

70
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,040
It's a wheeze, certainly.
Is it worse with exercise?

71
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,920
Yeah. I've been giving her
all the rest I can,

72
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,800
but I can't afford not to work her.

73
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
Its heaves, I'm afraid.

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,080
I thought so.
You can see she's having trouble.

75
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
It's taking
twice the effort to breathe.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,400
The air goes in,
but the lungs have lost elasticity,

77
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,280
so she's forced to use her abdominal
muscles to push it out again.

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,960
What's brought it on? Sensitivity
to mould or dust, usually.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,080
Soaking the hay before she feeds
can help.

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,760
I'll give her an arsenical
expectorant for her drinking water.

81
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,120
That should ease things.
But will it cure her?

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
Well... It's just
that she's Tom's, is Teasel.

83
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
I know
he's always been very fond of her.

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
I'd hate for my grandson
to come back home and...

85
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,520
You know. He's away with the army.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,400
She's young and strong. I can't see
why she wouldn't recover.

87
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
I'll do my damnedest to help,
in any case. Thanks.

88
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,880
I keep telling her,
"Take another lad on."

89
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,840
Won't listen. Too much like
replacing Tom, she reckons.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Well,
she's done well to cope on her own.

91
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,280
There's work here for three,
at least.

92
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,720
Doesn't help
with that lot training next door.

93
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,960
We're grateful to them,
but it's not easy.

94
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,600
More to come, I'm afraid.

95
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Things are about to get a great deal
more difficult, by all accounts.

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,840
Mrs Pumphrey,
you said it was an emergency. It is.

97
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,440
My community tea party's
just around the corner.

98
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,840
The aim is to raise
everyone's spirits,

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,920
not bombard them with noxious gas.

100
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
Perhaps
one could keep the dog outside?

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,320
Banish him
from the bosom of his foster family?

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh,
I couldn't countenance such cruelty.

103
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,960
Do you always treat your animals
like people?

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,240
Yes, Tricki, I quite agree.
He's not like Uncle Herriot.

105
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,000
I suggest we reduce Cedric's protein
intake and try him on an antacid.

106
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Should clear things up in no time.
Oh, how marvellous.

107
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,600
That's so kind of you,
Uncle Herriot. We're very grateful.

108
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,040
And you, too, I suppose...
Mr Cardomy.

109
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,400
I thought
we'd never discover the trouble.

110
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Yes. She's not one to be candid
about delicate matters.

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,680
The animals are the easy part,
of course.

112
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,840
It's the people
cause all the bother.

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
Ah, this is Mrs Hall,
our housekeeper extraordinaire.

114
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,200
Hello. Richard Carmody.

115
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,040
How do you do? Make yourself
at home. You're very welcome.

116
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,400
If you'd be kind enough to show me
where to put my things,

117
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,720
I shall get myself settled in.

118
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
Mrs Micklethwait
has a room for you.

119
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,760
Very clean, very particular.
Just across the square.

120
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Uh, there was a misunderstanding
with Mr Farnon. Who's just got back.

121
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
After you.

122
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,320
Mr Carmody, I presume?
You presume right. Final year, RVC?

123
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,120
Yes, specialising in equine science.
Hm. Standards must be slipping.

124
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm not sure I understand.
You were late. I was not.

125
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,680
I arrived in Darrowby
an hour ahead of schedule,

126
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,000
only to discover
the street signs had been removed

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,320
to discourage enemy invaders.

128
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,480
It took a little extra time
to locate Skeldale House,

129
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
through no fault of my own,

130
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,360
and yet I arrived at three sharp,
as arranged with Mr Herriot.

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,360
I stand corrected.
Farnon, Siegfried. Don't ask.

132
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,120
It's a pleasure, sir.

133
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,000
Cuppa tea?

134
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,440
Siegfried barked,
but he didn't bite.

135
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,440
All went rather well.
So far, so good.

136
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Carmody? Hello, again.
And this must be Mrs Herriot.

137
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,800
How do you do?
How do you do?

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Thought I should familiarise myself
with the animals in for observation.

139
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,400
Oh,
we can do that together tomorrow.

140
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
I don't mind showing him now.

141
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,760
No need.
You sure?

142
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Quite sure. I'll catch you up.

143
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
It's his first night,
and I am supposed to be his mentor.

144
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
This'll only take an hour or so.

145
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Oh, I tell you what,
shall we just stay in?

146
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm dead on me feet, anyway.

147
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,200
We can make up for it on Saturday.
Saturday's Mrs Pumphrey's tea party.

148
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
Not if we make our excuses.
I could send my assistant instead.

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh.
See, has its perks.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,640
And everyone will be out.

151
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,120
Well, when you put it that way.
It'll be worth it, once he learns.

152
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,760
I promise.
Let's hope he's a quick learner.

153
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
He's only been a few days,

154
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,280
but it's nice to have
another lad about the place.

155
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,360
But he'll take some getting to know,
I think.

156
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,880
You reckon he'll stick?
Well, he seems very confident.

157
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,520
Young.

158
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,920
We'll see.

159
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Well, I'm looking forward to meeting
him at Mrs Pumphrey's do. Yes.

160
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,040
But, um...

161
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,560
Before we go, I... I wanted...

162
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
What?
Oh, never mind.

163
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,600
It'll keep.
All right. Until later, then.

164
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,280
I'll see you at the Manor.

165
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,520
Or you could try saying it.

166
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,120
W-Whatever's been eating away
at you. You can tell?

167
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,600
Course I can. I know you, Audrey.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,080
Look, if you...
If you're giving me the elbow,

169
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,440
I'd rather have it straight.

170
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,960
No, I'm not giving you the elbow.
No? No.

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm...

172
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,800
..getting a divorce.

173
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
There he is. How was Sharpe's cow?

174
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,200
Nervous, acid anaemic
and extremely slobbery.

175
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Do wish you'd fetched me.

176
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,880
Not sure Mrs Micklethwait
would have agreed at 4AM.

177
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,800
Oh, put the kettle on
while you're up, will you?

178
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
Mrs Hall's out with Gerald.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Acid anaemia. Comes up like
clockwork in the exam, you know?

180
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,240
Yes. But I can't make up my mind
which theory I endorse.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,560
Stevens maintains it's the
incomplete oxidation of fatty acids.

182
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Shalamar leans towards
liver intoxication.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And Jansen implicates

184
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,280
one of the centres
of the autonomic nervous system.

185
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,800
What's your view?

186
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,240
If we could pinpoint the exact cause
of the production of diacetic acid

187
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,440
and beta-oxobutyric acid
in the metabolism,

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,160
we'd be well on the way
to understanding the problem.

189
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Don't you agree?
I do, wholeheartedly. James?

190
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Absolutely. Yes.

191
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,320
I thought, perhaps, we could get
to grips with the dispensary later.

192
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,120
Oh, I've just offered to take him
to Chapman's,

193
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,440
um, following up with Teasel.

194
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,560
Heaves.
Also known as pulmonary emphysema.

195
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
Sounds like an interesting case.

196
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,440
We'll start there, then.
No reason to trouble yourself.

197
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm afraid
you're due at Pumphrey Manor.

198
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
Cedric's flatulence hasn't abated.

199
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,920
"Ventos regere non possum."
"Sed vela aptare possum."

200
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,200
"One can't control the wind."
"The wind."

201
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,680
Very good!

202
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,200
Did everything you said
to the letter.

203
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,320
How does that sound?

204
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,120
Encouraging.
It worked, wetting her hey and that?

205
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Reducing her exposure to allergens
has decreased

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,480
the chronic inflammation
of the lungs.

207
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,760
That means she's on the mend.

208
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Tom will be pleased to hear that,
won't he?

209
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,360
He will. Thanks, Mr Farnon.
It means the world.

210
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
Close the damn gate!
Sorry.

211
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Keep your hair on, fella.

212
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,200
What about you? Do you see yourself
joining their illustrious ranks?

213
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,320
Never, if I have anything
to do with it. Really?

214
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,360
Our new PM believes
suffering lies ahead.

215
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,520
That suffering will be greater
if we cannot feed the country.

216
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,080
True. I intend to serve
by doing my duty to our farmers.

217
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,600
We're a reserved occupation
for a reason. Indeed, we are.

218
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Oh!

219
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
Cedric. Oh!

220
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Cedric.

221
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,160
Ooh, Cedric.

222
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,080
Oh dear.
I'm so sorry, Uncle Herriot.

223
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,920
I am afraid he's proving to be
something of a handful.

224
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,360
Tricki and I haven't slept a wink

225
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,480
because of
his bounding and... whining.

226
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,720
I have never known
a dog so boisterous and clingy.

227
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,120
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm talking about you.

228
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,720
And how about his wind?
The frequency's reduced a little.

229
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
However, the magnitude has not.

230
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,880
I've decided to move my party
alfresco, to be on the safe side.

231
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,200
And his diet?
Suitably meagre, as instructed.

232
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,680
Well?
He's a picture of health.

233
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
I'm not quite sure
what else to suggest.

234
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,240
Where was he just now?

235
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Out for his daily walk
with Francois.

236
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,080
Once might not be enough.
He's not the lapdog you're used to.

237
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,400
Increasing his exercise
should calm him down a bit.

238
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,800
We could do with some calm,
couldn't we, Tricki?

239
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,040
Yes. We are extremely fatigued.

240
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,440
Well, I'm sure
the party later will revive you.

241
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,560
Yes, that and community relations,
I hope.

242
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I've extended the invitation
to the infantry training camp.

243
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,160
I've heard they've certainly
been making their presence felt.

244
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,320
Mm. Which is why it's time
we got to know each other. Mm.

245
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,800
If anyone needs a morale boost,
it's those young men.

246
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,240
Mm. I hope it goes swimmingly.
You'll be coming, of course?

247
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
I thought
you were gonna send Carmody?

248
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I am, but she wouldn't let me
off the hook.

249
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Mrs Pumphrey,
she's like a boa constrictor.

250
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,800
The more you struggle,
the tighter the grip.

251
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,440
Ooh, I should ask her for some tips.

252
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,520
Before you say it...
Not another plan?

253
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,680
It's a good one.

254
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,480
James, if we can't have any time
together, I'd rather stop here.

255
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,480
Get me never-ending list of jobs
done. Listen, listen.

256
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,040
We go to the party,
do a quick circuit.

257
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,680
As soon as the coast is clear,
we sneak off without saying goodbye.

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,320
Enjoy the whole afternoon at home,
alone.

259
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,600
All right. But I'll be holding you
to that. I certainly hope so.

260
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,520
How was
Teasel's pulmonary emphysema?

261
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Clearing up very nicely.
Glad to hear it.

262
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,240
We can discuss treatment protocols

263
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
before we head to the party,
if you'd like?

264
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Oh, that's all right. I've been
through them all with Mr Farnon.

265
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
Do you drive, Carmody?

266
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,640
Never got around to it.
Oh. Have to see about that. Will we?

267
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Can't see
us having time to teach him.

268
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,640
Impressive chap like Carmody?
Duck to water.

269
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
What I mean is
he'll have his studies to return to,

270
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,440
and no doubt he intends to join
up... That's just it, he doesn't.

271
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
He means to serve as a vet. At home.

272
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,560
You know, I was too hasty
when I said he wouldn't last.

273
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,640
I think he suits us very well,
indeed.

274
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,120
Excellent work finding him, James.
Truly.

275
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,640
Last one to the Manor's
a rotten egg.

276
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,040
How did I become Tristan?

277
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
Don't talk daft!

278
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, there's Gerald.
Excuse me a minute.

279
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,160
Come on.

280
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,120
The sooner we've shown our faces,
sooner we can go, remember?

281
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,680
Thanks very much.

282
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,640
And, er, do your parents live
in London, Mr Carmody?

283
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,920
Occasionally. They're mostly abroad.
Oh?

284
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Can't bear to be in one place
for long.

285
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,280
So you're well-travelled, too?

286
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,360
Only as far
as boarding school and college.

287
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
Well, if it isn't Cedric.

288
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
I should check
on how he's bearing up.

289
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,520
Don't forget your gas mask, lad (!)

290
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,800
Audrey keeps me abreast
of all your goings-on.

291
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,520
I expect
our goings-on are more eventful

292
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,880
than your average day at the bank.

293
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,080
You'd be surprised.
Really?

294
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Might go see about some cake.

295
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,520
Hello there, boy.

296
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,160
Still knocking everyone for six,
is he?

297
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,920
His odour makes me long to return
to France.

298
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,800
France has just been invaded,
old chap.

299
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,640
Exactement.
Gosh.

300
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,560
Well, what's Mr Herriot treating him
with? Er, walking.

301
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
Just walking?
Lots of walking.

302
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,520
Hm. Wonder what good that'll do.
Plenty for his behaviour, actually.

303
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,720
Interesting.

304
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,000
And what about his digestion?

305
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,440
Er, there's nothing wrong
with his digestion.

306
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,640
But wouldn't his persistent gas
suggest otherwise?

307
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,080
And that's when we realised.

308
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,280
It wasn't Lady Middlethorpe
emptying her account,

309
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,840
it was her butler.

310
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Fur coat, wig, bold as brass.
Never! The butler did it!

311
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,280
The butler did it!
Only he didn't

312
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,280
cos three of us grabbed him
before he could leg it.

313
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,960
Oh, that tale tickles Audrey.
Well, I hope you tell it often.

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,560
It's been a difficult time for her.
Oh?

315
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,680
Well, you know about...
Oh, her situation, yes.

316
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
But she made the right decision,
I reckon.

317
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,280
Oh, undoubtedly, yes.

318
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
You see the weight lift off her
shoulders with every passing week.

319
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,320
Perhaps it's time we sort out

320
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,640
something a little stronger
than tea.

321
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
Erm, excuse me, Mr Farnon.

322
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,200
I should see where Audrey got to.
Righto.

323
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,480
You!
Er, the lady said

324
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,280
we could help ourselves.
We've met.

325
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,920
Large animals and roads do not mix,
which is why we have gates.

326
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,120
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

327
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,480
Where are you from?
Hulme. Manchester.

328
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
So a fish out of water, then?

329
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,680
Don't see too many fields
as a plumber's apprentice, sir.

330
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,520
Well, you're welcome here,
of course you are.

331
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,960
But you must respect
the way we do things.

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,680
I trust
you'll spread the word on that.

333
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,600
No sign of infection or parasites?

334
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
No, which is why I'm certain
it's a behavioural problem.

335
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
And my diagnosis
is not a matter for debate.

336
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,120
What are we debating?
Something that will wait.

337
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,880
Mr Herriot thinks Cedric's
flatulence is all in his head.

338
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,600
I suspect it's more gut-related.
What do you think?

339
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,080
Well, considering who he lives with,
I'd say it's his gut.

340
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,480
Then you'd be wrong.

341
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,920
He's in a new place
with a new owner.

342
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
It's likely he's boisterous,
but he's anxious.

343
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,960
Anxiety can lead to gas.
As can rich food.

344
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Speaking of food, I'm famished.
Why don't we leave them to it?

345
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,520
Cedric's on a strict diet.

346
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,120
Strict has always been
an elastic concept to Mrs Pumphrey.

347
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
James.
Just a minute.

348
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,120
She has form for spoiling her pets,
but...

349
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,280
You said she was bound
to be overindulging Cedric.

350
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,160
I know you're trying to impress,

351
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,480
but it's best if
you defer to my experience on this.

352
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,160
Experience tells me
you might be in the doghouse, James.

353
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,520
I've been rushed off me feet, too.

354
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm just as tired as you are.
I know, I know.

355
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
I haven't time to stand around
listening to some petty argument.

356
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,480
I really am sorry.
We'll go now, like we planned.

357
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,480
No thanks.
I've gone off the idea. Helen.

358
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
I'll make my own way home.

359
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,880
You can argue about flatulence
to your heart's content.

360
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm going.

361
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Stay there, boy. I'll be back.

362
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,840
There you are.

363
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,880
Oh, this makes my garden look like
a postage stamp.

364
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,720
Sure it's still lovely.

365
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
I should like to show it to you.

366
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,280
Did you and Mr Farnon
get along all right?

367
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
Very well.

368
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,360
You came up a bit.

369
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,960
Oh! More interesting things
to talk about than me, surely.

370
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,040
You know, I-I understand
why you didn't come to me first.

371
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,000
About what?
Well, what you told me earlier.

372
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,840
Sounded like Mr Farnon has known
about it for some time.

373
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,560
I didn't go to him.

374
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,680
It... It were
more he happened upon me...

375
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,600
..filling in the forms and such.

376
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Weeks ago?

377
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,000
I suppose so. Yes.

378
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,680
But I didn't want to bother you with
summat that might not be granted.

379
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,200
I weren't ready to tell anyone.

380
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,960
Although I did sort of end up...
mentioning it to Helen.

381
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,760
And I can't be sure, but
I expect she might have told James.

382
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
Uncle Herriot. What's the matter?

383
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,240
Nothing, I'm enjoying the party.
Very much.

384
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,560
Mm. I couldn't help noticing
Mrs Herriot making herself scarce.

385
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
My fault.

386
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Here.

387
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Drink up.

388
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,480
Gin?

389
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,440
One can't get through these things
without a little pick-me-up.

390
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,880
Thank you.
Now, what exactly did you do?

391
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,680
Lost sight of my priorities.

392
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,320
Somehow made her feel second-best
to Cedric.

393
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,840
Cedric?

394
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,400
She's left, gone home.

395
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,560
Thought I'd give her
a chance to cool off.

396
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you'll do no such thing.

397
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,040
Cedric should be the least of
your worries. You must follow her.

398
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
At once!

399
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
You sure you're all right?

400
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm sure.

401
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,400
You needed an heir, they provided
it, I'm glad they were able to.

402
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,280
Thing is... with Robert, he'd stew.

403
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
Say summat were fine
when it weren't,

404
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,120
so if I've upset you...
You haven't.

405
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,240
Course you haven't.

406
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm nothing like him, Audrey.
Oh, hush. I know. But...

407
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,920
You'd rather have it straight,
same as me. I would.

408
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
All right.

409
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,640
I do wish you told me first.

410
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,320
But only cos I'd like you to know
that... you can come to me...

411
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
..about anything.

412
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,440
Cos I never want you to feel

413
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,880
the way you did with your husband
ever again. Alone or...

414
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
..afraid.

415
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Thank you.

416
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,280
Not that I'm getting
any ideas or anything.

417
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,280
But you aren't on your own any more.
You've got my ear too now.

418
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,200
If you want it.

419
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I do.

420
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,640
Right, then.

421
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
Is it time for tea?

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Not just yet.

423
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,680
Easy.

424
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,920
That's it.

425
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,880
Hello again, Mrs Pumphrey.
Oh, Mr Carmody, Mr Farnon.

426
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
We've been having
a spirited debate about Cedric.

427
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,480
Funny you should say that. I was
just wondering where he'd got to.

428
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,560
With Uncle Herriot, I believe.

429
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,760
He wasn't with him
when we spoke before.

430
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,520
Whose is that dog eating
the food? That's not right.

431
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,760
Perhaps Francois took him
for another walk.

432
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,440
Get off! What you doing? Down, boy!
Whoa! Oh!

433
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,680
Ah. There he is.
No!

434
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,520
I just found Teasel by the road.

435
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,360
She must have gotten loose.
Has she been hit?

436
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Worse, possibly. Impaled on a fence.
Come on.

437
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,640
Come on.

438
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,240
Come on, we need to act quickly.

439
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,360
We'll never get it out
while she's still attached.

440
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,920
It's broken, it shouldn't be
too hard to separate.

441
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Bone saw?
Good idea.

442
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,240
No, no, keep the pressure on.

443
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,600
Sorry, erm...

444
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,280
How about a sedative?
Think, Carmody. Pulmonary emphysema.

445
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,160
We can't fully sedate her
if she has difficulty breathing.

446
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,800
It's in the Rover.
The sedative? The saw.

447
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Good God,
I forget how green they are.

448
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,920
Quite.

449
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,080
It's all right, old girl.
It'll soon be over.

450
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,440
James will now set you right.

451
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,840
It's a crying shame, innit?
All this cake going to waste. Hm!

452
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,760
You should see
the slop they give us at camp.

453
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,080
I'd give my eyeteeth
for a roast dinner.

454
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,320
I'd bring you one every day if you
lot would stop leaving gates open.

455
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,520
I've already had
a dressing down about that.

456
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,840
You do know half the gates
around here are knackered?

457
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,920
Really? Wonder why.

458
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,120
T'folk who fix 'em are away.
Just like you.

459
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh.
Mm.

460
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,040
I didn't know that. Sorry.

461
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,600
And about the dog, too.
That was you an' all?

462
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Well, I was minding my business,
and he got all excited.

463
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,040
He would have licked me to death
if I hadn't scarpered.

464
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,320
That was quite the faux pas.

465
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,200
You must stay here
until you've calmed down.

466
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Just have a jolly good think
about what you've done, hmm?

467
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,800
Sorry to disturb.
Francois said it was all right.

468
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,240
Mrs Herriot?
I thought you'd run for the hills.

469
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,440
I turned back.

470
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
I might have jumped the gun a bit.

471
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,640
James told me
he'd made a pig's ear of things.

472
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,880
Over Cedric of all people!
He's why I'm here, actually.

473
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,600
As much as I hate to say it,
I think James was right.

474
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,320
It's not what Cedric's eating,
it's who he were chasing.

475
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,720
Soldiers.
He were excited to see 'em.

476
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Makes sense. His daddy's a soldier.

477
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,440
When he dropped him off,
did he leave any toys or blankets?

478
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,280
A small few.
But they were unsanitary.

479
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,400
Did you keep 'em?

480
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,760
Francois?

481
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,200
Francois!

482
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,320
Almost there. Brace yourselves.

483
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,960
This'll hurt her.
On my count... one...

484
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,880
two... three.

485
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,880
Stand, stand, stand.

486
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,120
That's a good girl.

487
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,040
You all right?
Yes, just kicking myself.

488
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,200
Horses are my speciality.

489
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,640
I should have taken her condition
into account. Chin up.

490
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,960
You're here to learn,
and we learn from our mistakes.

491
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,560
Well, watch Mr Herriot and me
very closely.

492
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,840
This next part's the difficult bit.

493
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,200
A trick me mam used to do
whenever we gave away newborn pups.

494
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,920
I've never seen him in such repose.
Hm. Smells like home. And his dad.

495
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Oh, Cedric, darling.
You've been homesick all along.

496
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,360
He really has been anxious,
hasn't he?

497
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,960
Probably why
he's been such a handful. Mm.

498
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
If he keeps the blanket,
it'll calm him down.

499
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
Help him feel more settled.

500
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,360
Oh! Peace at last. Wonderful!

501
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,920
Thank you.

502
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,080
Gently does it. Gently.

503
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,800
Any... second...

504
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
Ah. Easy.

505
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,680
Easy, easy, easy. Stand. Good girl.

506
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,040
Feels all right.

507
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,280
Chest wall?

508
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,840
Hasn't been penetrated.
Muscle damage?

509
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,840
No worse than you'd expect.

510
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,240
Lucky girl. Right,
let's flush her for splinters.

511
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,680
Give her a tetanus anti-toxin.

512
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,360
Close her up sharpish.
Yep, all of that.

513
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,920
Run up to the cottage,
find Mrs Chapman.

514
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
James and I can do the rest.

515
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,880
I'd love to see James's face
when he discovers you solved it.

516
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,800
Goodness knows when that will be.

517
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,680
I think they all ran off
on some emergency.

518
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,800
Heavens. He's dedicated.

519
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,720
He is. And I wouldn't have him
any other way, but...

520
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,160
You'd rather see more of him.

521
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
We've got all these plans.

522
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,920
I don't know if
we'll achieve any of them before...

523
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,680
you know. He might have to leave.

524
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
And when I point it out to him,

525
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,920
he acts like we've got all t'time
in the world. It's... Infuriating?

526
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
Mm. Mm. My husband, Charles,
was infuriating.

527
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,600
When we bought this house,
he was bursting with plans.

528
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,200
The first was to fill the place
with dogs.

529
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,040
Utter chaos!
He was an animal lover, too?

530
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,400
Pottier than me.
He had quite a menagerie.

531
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,080
He bought me my first Pekinese.
Tricki's great-great-grandmother.

532
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,600
Aww, that's lovely.
That's why he's so dear to me.

533
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,160
Charles died young. Very suddenly.
I'm so sorry.

534
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,480
I was left here with a lot of dogs.

535
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,120
And grand ideas.

536
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,640
Your instinct is absolutely right.
Time is precious.

537
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,920
But forgive quickly, dear girl.

538
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,680
Especially now.

539
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,160
We need to keep a close eye
on the wound,

540
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,040
but if it heals properly,
and there's no nerve damage,

541
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,920
I can't see any reason why
she shouldn't make a full recovery.

542
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,200
I can't tell you how thankful I am,
Mr Farnum.

543
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,320
And how sorry.
For what? Well...

544
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,720
..t'gate needed fixing, and...

545
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,920
with Tom away,
I've not been facing up to things.

546
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,720
Teasel's borne the brunt of it.
I'm sure that's not the case.

547
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,440
But I do know how hard it can be...
to ask for help.

548
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,640
I don't want help,
I want my son back home and safe.

549
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,280
How are we supposed to just...
Carry on without them?

550
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,080
Haven't a damn clue.

551
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,280
Take comfort in those we do have,
I suppose.

552
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,840
There's also whisky.

553
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,520
You're such an idiot.

554
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,680
I am. And I'm so sorry.
You were right. I was wrong.

555
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,640
I'll make it up to you, I swear.

556
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,920
Let's just promise we'll make time
for each other. Soon.

557
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,440
Of course. Hand on heart.

558
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,400
Where did Carmody get to?

559
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,800
Oh, something about
fetching a book from his lodgings.

560
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,760
He's a lot left to learn.
Well, he knows that after today.

561
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,120
James thinks you poached him.

562
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
Really?
I know, I know, I'm a fool.

563
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,080
A little bit. You can have him
as your assistant if you like.

564
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,520
The two of us working together
as a team made today a success.

565
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,400
A little lively debate with Carmody

566
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,840
is no substitute
for your skill and experience.

567
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,440
I know, I see that now.
I've been a bit selfish.

568
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
The fact is, if I am called up,
I won't be here for the next Teasel.

569
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,080
Neither will Tris.

570
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,360
And I will need help.

571
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,360
Which is why you welcomed Carmody in
with open arms. After a fashion.

572
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,000
It's very galling. I was
soldiering on alone perfectly well

573
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,160
before you thrust yourself upon me.

574
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,840
So, this is where
you all slunk off to.

575
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,600
Hello.
There was an emergency first.

576
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,920
And now we're slinking off home,
so...

577
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,320
Excuse us.
Oh.

578
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,160
Mrs Hall, there's a slight chance
I put my foot in it with Gerald.

579
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,840
Yes. You did. But you didn't.

580
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,880
All turned out rather nicely.
Well, I'm relieved to hear it.

581
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
We might try and catch the pictures.

582
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,760
Would you be all right
fending for yourself tonight?

583
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,760
There's cold cuts in the larder.
Or leftover pie if you'd prefer.

584
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
Pie would be splendid.

585
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,160
Night, then.
Good night.

586
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,280
Can we help you?
All right.

587
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,520
We're making ourselves useful.
Got anything that wants fixing?

588
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,640
I have, as a matter of fact.
Come on.

589
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
So, what's your name?
It's Briggs. Sidney Briggs.

590
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,240
Nice to meet you, Briggs.

591
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,240
Finally. Just the two of us.

592
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,640
Would you hate me
if I said I'd rather get some sleep?

593
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,880
No, I'd worship
the ground you walk on.

594
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,960
You all right? I'm just really weepy
today for some reason.

595
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,440
Hey, you're exhausted.

596
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,040
Grumpy.
Never.

597
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,680
We should turn in.

598
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,720
Hang on, let me check something.

599
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,400
Mr Farnum?
I was hoping we could go over

600
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,280
the finer points
of today's procedure. Of course.

601
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,120
I trust it was educational?
I'll say.

602
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,000
Although I couldn't help noticing
you didn't use tissue forceps.

603
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,000
I've been taught that's the proper
way, more precise and sterile.

604
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,000
"Proper"?
Yes. Perhaps the Babcock or Allis

605
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,080
forceps would have helped?

606
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,560
Babcock and Allis
are only found in textbooks.

607
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,480
No vet carries them.

608
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,280
It was just a thought.

609
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,840
Carmody, do you want to complete
this placement?

610
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,640
Very much so, yes.

611
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,720
Then may I suggest you try keeping
some of your thoughts to yourself?

612
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,760
Unless you thought of
buying me another drink, of course.

613
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,880
Same again?
That's more like it.

614
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,920
Might not be as alone as we think.

615
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,920
Don't tell me
we're expecting someone.

616
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,600
Sort of.

617
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm fairly certain
it won't be just the two of us.

618
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,040
More like three.

619
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,120
Three?

620
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,000
You know
I've been tired all the time.

621
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,560
We might be getting our little James
a bit sooner than expected.

622
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,200
You never... Already?
Think so!

623
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,280
I got so carried away
with us not getting there,

624
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,040
I forgot to check me dates.
Well, how far?

625
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,880
Not far. It's early days.

626
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,360
Are you happy?
Ecstatic.

627
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,240
Couldn't have gone better
if we planned it.
